You are working on the Artemis Gate frontend (backoffice app).

GOAL:
Create the initial "Gate Home" page for backoffice users (Operations Analyst), following best UX practices for operational workflows and speed.

SCOPE (IMPORTANT – DO NOT EXCEED):
- Only frontend (client/)
- Do NOT touch backend, ARISE, or API implementation
- Do NOT refactor existing Inbox or Debug pages
- You MAY add routes, components, and small shared utilities if strictly needed

CONTEXT:
- Artemis ecosystem:
  - Hunting = field app (credit agent)
  - ARISE = backend
  - Gate = backoffice
- Gate users analyze proposals coming from Hunting via ARISE
- First operational stage is DOC_REVIEW (document & data validation)

HOME PAGE OBJECTIVE:
Provide an operational overview and fast access to proposals.

The Gate Home must:
1. Be accessible at route: /gate/home
2. Be the default landing page after login
3. Focus on operational clarity, not sales metrics

HOME CONTENT (REQUIRED):
A) Header
- Title: "Gate Overview"
- Subtitle: "Operational overview of incoming credit proposals"

B) KPI / Status Cards (4 cards)
Each card shows:
- Stage name
- Count of proposals in that stage
- Short description
- Action button ("View")

Required stages:
- DOC_REVIEW → "New proposals to review"
- UNDER_EVAL → "Analysis in progress"
- RISK_EVAL (or equivalent next stage) → "Sent to risk evaluation"
- COMPLETED → "Finished reviews"

Counts should be fetched using existing listProposals(stage) API.
If API returns empty or fails, show 0 safely (no crash).

C) Quick Actions
- Button: "Go to Inbox" → /gate/inbox
- Button: "Debug & Connectivity" → /gate/debug

D) UX / Design
- Use existing Card, Button, icons (lucide-react)
- Match visual language of GateLayout and Inbox
- Clean, professional, operational (no flashy charts)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Reuse listProposals(stage)
- Handle loading and error states gracefully
- Do NOT duplicate logic already in Inbox unless necessary
- Keep code readable and commented

FILES YOU MAY TOUCH / CREATE:
- client/src/pages/gate/home.tsx (main page)
- client/src/App.tsx or router config (ONLY if needed to register /gate/home)
- Small helper components ONLY if justified

DELIVERABLE:
After finishing, output:
1) List of files created or modified
2) Short explanation of how to test:
   - Which URL to open
   - What should appear
   - Expected behavior if API has zero proposals

IMPORTANT:
Do not over-engineer.
This is an MVP home focused on speed, clarity, and flow visibility.
