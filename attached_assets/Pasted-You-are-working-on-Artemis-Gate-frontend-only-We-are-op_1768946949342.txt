You are working on Artemis Gate (frontend-only). We are operating in an economical mode: do not overbuild, minimal changes, avoid touching many files.

GOAL:
Enhance the Gate Home page to (1) match the real workflow stages and (2) include a Business Performance section (monthly KPIs) similar in spirit to the Hunt app dashboard.

STRICT SCOPE:
- Frontend only (client/)
- Do NOT modify backend or ARISE
- Avoid refactoring Inbox/Debug pages
- Prefer to change ONLY: client/src/pages/gate/home.tsx
- You may add very small helper functions inside home.tsx if needed
- If you need new API calls, implement them in the smallest possible way and reuse existing patterns

CURRENT ISSUE TO FIX:
Home currently triggers API Error 400 about invalid/missing stage parameter.
Backend validStages are: ["DOC_REVIEW","RISK_REVIEW","APPROVED","REJECTED"].
Do NOT call stages that backend doesn’t recognize (e.g., UNDER_EVAL if not supported).

WORKFLOW MODEL (must be reflected in UI):
- Proposals arrive from Hunt into DOC_REVIEW
- After Ops Analyst starts working but doesn’t finish, we want “Under Evaluation / In Progress” visibility
- When Ops Analyst approves, it moves to RISK_REVIEW
- Completed only when Risk Analyst finishes evaluation:
   - APPROVED or REJECTED

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT:
Backend may not have a real stage called UNDER_EVAL.
Therefore, compute “Under Evaluation / In Progress” as a derived metric:
- If proposal stage == DOC_REVIEW AND proposal has evidence of being started (e.g., has any decision draft / audit trail / updatedAt != submittedAt), count it as “In Progress”
- If we cannot reliably detect “started”, then represent “In Progress” as 0 for now but keep the card and label it as “In Progress (derived)”.

HOME PAGE REQUIRED LAYOUT:

SECTION 1 — Operational Workflow (cards)
Display 4 workflow cards with counts and a “View” button:
1) DOC_REVIEW → “New to review”
2) IN_PROGRESS (derived from DOC_REVIEW) → “Work started, not finished”
3) RISK_REVIEW → “Sent to risk evaluation”
4) COMPLETED → show combined count of APPROVED + REJECTED

View behavior:
- Clicking “View” should navigate to /gate/inbox with the closest applicable stage selected.
- Since inbox stage selector may not support APPROVED/REJECTED, use a sensible fallback:
   - DOC_REVIEW card -> /gate/inbox (stage DOC_REVIEW)
   - IN_PROGRESS card -> /gate/inbox (stage DOC_REVIEW) + a query param like ?focus=in_progress (optional). If that’s too invasive, skip the param.
   - RISK_REVIEW card -> /gate/inbox (if inbox supports RISK_REVIEW; if not, still route to inbox and show message)
   - COMPLETED card -> /gate/inbox (fallback to DOC_REVIEW) OR provide a disabled state saying “Completed proposals view coming soon”

SECTION 2 — Business Performance (monthly KPIs)
Add a second section below workflow called:
“Business Performance”
Subtitle: “Key indicators for this month (real-time)”

KPIs to display (cards):
- Approved this month (count + total amount)
- New clients this month (count)
- Total active clients (count)
- Credit portfolio size (total outstanding)
- Delinquency rate (percentage)
- Optional: Disbursements this month (total amount)

IMPORTANT: Backend may not yet provide these metrics.
Implementation approach:
- First: attempt to fetch from a single endpoint (if exists) like:
   GET /api/gate/metrics?period=month
- If it does not exist, do NOT break the UI. Show placeholders:
   - “--” or 0
   - and a small neutral note “Metrics endpoint not available yet”
- Do NOT create fake data.
- Use minimal request attempts and robust error handling.
- Reuse existing formatting helpers (formatCurrency, formatValue, etc.) if available.

SECTION 3 — Quick Actions
Keep quick actions:
- Go to Inbox
- Debug & Connectivity

UI / DESIGN:
- Keep style consistent with existing Gate components (Card, Button, lucide icons)
- Clean, operational, fast scanning
- Include a refresh button that refetches all queries

DATA FETCHING RULES:
- Use React Query
- For stage counts: only call backend with validStages: DOC_REVIEW, RISK_REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED
- Normalize responses defensively (array vs {items})
- Prevent runtime crashes

DELIVERABLE:
After implementation, output:
1) Files modified
2) What stage mapping you used
3) How to test:
   - open /gate/home
   - confirm no 400 error
   - confirm cards show counts (0 if none)
   - confirm refresh works
4) If metrics endpoint not found, show how UI degrades safely
