TARGET: Replit Agent — Artemis Gate (frontend)

Goal: Gate UI shows 0 proposals in Overview even though Arise API returns proposals (count=2) for /api/gate/proposals?stage=DOC_REVIEW. Fix the UI integration so Overview + Inbox reflect real data from Arise.

Context / Evidence:
- VITE_API_BASE_URL is set to: https://artemis-arise--arthursmt89.replit.app
- Network request from Gate to Arise succeeds:
  GET https://artemis-arise--arthursmt89.replit.app/api/gate/proposals?stage=DOC_REVIEW
  Status 200
  Response example:
  {
    "stage":"DOC_REVIEW",
    "count":2,
    "proposals":[ ... ]
  }
- However Gate Overview "Doc Review" card still shows 0, and Inbox list shows only sample data / not the submitted proposals.

Tasks:
1) Identify which endpoint(s) the Gate Overview cards use to compute counts (DOC_REVIEW, RISK_REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED).
   - Check the data-fetching code for Overview (Home page) and Inbox page.
   - Confirm whether Overview uses /api/gate/proposals, or a separate /api/gate/metrics|summary endpoint.
2) Ensure Gate uses real API data (not sample/mock) whenever VITE_API_BASE_URL is configured and API health is OK.
3) Fix any response-shape mismatch:
   - If UI expects `items` but API returns `proposals`, map correctly.
   - Ensure `count` is used correctly.
4) If Overview needs a metrics endpoint and it’s missing, implement client-side aggregation:
   - Fetch proposals per stage and compute counts.
   - Or add a single endpoint call if already available.
5) Add lightweight logging in the client (console.log in dev mode) to print:
   - request URL(s)
   - parsed response keys
   - computed counts
   so we can verify quickly in the browser devtools.

Acceptance criteria:
- Gate Overview cards show correct non-zero counts matching the API response.
- Gate Inbox shows the real proposals returned by Arise (including the latest submitted proposal).
- No "API not configured" banner when VITE_API_BASE_URL is set.
- Works on the published Gate URL after republish.
